Dionne's Contribution:

To start the project, I created the initial HTML and CSS documents for all four pages.

For general HTML -

 Pages were made with basic meta data and a basic header including the nav buttons linked to their respective pages and the "visually hidden" class to a main content skip button for accessibility. The documents also included some basic body structure and a basic footer structure for social media icons to be added.

For general CSS -
 The document was created with a reset followed by basic styles for the page. I then added in base styles for the header, including the nav buttons with a hover and key frames as well as basic styles for the footer. All of the styles for header and footer were later edited and added to or discared by Drea who completed the final styling for those pieces.

For the Blog and Connect pages -
 I fully designed these pages aside froom the header and footer which were applied to all pages for cohesiveness. I searched for and downloaded all pics used on my pages (execpt for the profanity bubble which Drea found for me) and scalled them down as necessary to optimize loading time for the pages. I utilized flex and various types of scalable units for all styling so that the size and shape of every element properly responds to screen size, using @media break points to re-adjust items as necessary. At 500px in particular, I allowed for the various boxes to move to columns for easier viewing / readibility. All CSS is organized according to section and page and labeled to make it very easy to find the styling for everything.

 All of the "post snippets" on the blog pages were completely fabricated by me and I hope that anyone reading them will find them just as ammusing.

The main purpose of this site / product is largely base entertainment.
